# Projects

[Dog Vision](https://github.com/danielclark00/A.I/blob/0bf3f8158b8b96eef2cf06e4d4d364e30aafd1b6/projects/dog-vision.ipynb): This notebook builds an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using TenserFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub.

[Bulldozer Price Prediction](https://github.com/danielclark00/A.I/blob/0bf3f8158b8b96eef2cf06e4d4d364e30aafd1b6/projects/end-to-end-bulldozer-price-regression.ipynb): This notebook builds a machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers.

[Heart Disease Classification](https://github.com/danielclark00/A.I/blob/0bf3f8158b8b96eef2cf06e4d4d364e30aafd1b6/projects/end-to-end-heart-disease-classification.ipynb): This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

[Titanic Survival](https://github.com/danielclark00/A.I/blob/0bf3f8158b8b96eef2cf06e4d4d364e30aafd1b6/projects/titanic.ipynb): This notebook is the legendary Titanic ML competition that uses machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
